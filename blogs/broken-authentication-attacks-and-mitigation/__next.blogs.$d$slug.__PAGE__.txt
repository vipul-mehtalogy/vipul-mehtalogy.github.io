3:T828,<h2>Broken Authentication attacks and mitigation</h2>
<p>Broken authentication &amp; session management vulnerabilities are those in which the attacker exploits flaws to impersonate other users either through session hijacking, session manipulation or credential discovery.  </p>
<p>These flaws are the result of :  </p>
<ul>
<li>Poor session control and isolation - Relying on IP address for session, inadequate timeout or inactive sessions.</li>
<li>weak password recovery - forgotten password functionality.</li>
<li>Data security at rest or while transmission - poor or no data encryption</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mitigation / Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use multi-factor authentication</li>
<li>Validate input from the user at the client as well as at the server-side.</li>
<li>Use TLS encryption (HTTPS) for web request and response</li>
<li>Encrypt sensitive data in datastore</li>
<li>Use HTTP post method while playing with sensitive information</li>
<li>Consider countermeasure for Bruteforce attack, credential harvesting.</li>
<li>Consider using proven third-party authentication providers rather implementing your own</li>
<li>Avoid default exception rendering by technology and platform and use generic error messages. Log detailed error/exception messages on the server and do not expose then to end-users. Error/exception information can be used by the attacker.</li>
<li>Avoid remember me functionality of login for high value / risky application</li>
<li>Keep session timeout as low as possible. Promote manual log out in the application. The idea is to avoid abrupt session termination or inactive sessions and terminate sessions gracefully.</li>
<li>Implement appropriate password policy (change password after a certain period, passwords length &amp; complexity etc.)</li>
<li>Use strong session ID, do not share session id in URL or using HTTP get. Always generate new session id while login.</li>
<li>Never accept user-generated session id.</li>
<li>Use cookie best practices like httponly, non-persistent cookie etc.</li>
<li>Never use a self-signed certificate</li>
</ul>
