<li>HIPPA ensures that the electronic exchange of data follows a common data format.</li>
<li>PHI ensures what procedure and process to follow in order to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.</li>
<li>patients can authorize &amp; monitor data so that they can control what information shared with whom.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Electronic Data Interchange</h3>
<p>Transactions and code sets standards: standardize data formats so that software cost can be reduced, and easy to adapt information between different health care providers. It includes formats for the below administrative and financial functions</p>
<ul>

<h3>Security Rule</h3>
