3:T12f9,<h2>SLA for Virtual Machines</h2>
<ul>
<li>VMs that have two or more instances deployed across two or more availability zones in the same Azure region, MS guarantee 99.99% of connectivity to at least one instance.</li>
<li>99.95% connectivity to at least one instance if VMs deployed in the same availability set or in the same dedicated host group.</li>
<li>VM using premium SSD for OS and data disk shall have 99.9% connectivity guarantee, 99.5% in case of standard SSD, 95% in case of standard HDD.</li>
</ul>
<p>It implies that using 2 or more VM leads to 4 9 of availability means 4 min downtime in a month.</p>
<h2>Availability Set</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The logical grouping of VMs allows Azure to understand how the application is built to provide for redundancy and availability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no cost for the availability set itself, just need to pay for added VM instances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fault Domain: physical separation of these virtual machines so that no hardware failure will disrupt both of them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Update domain</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Availability Zone</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is a physically separate zone, within an Azure region.</li>
<li>There are three availability zones per Azure region.</li>
<li>Each availability zone as a distinct power source, network, and cooling.</li>
<li>It protects applications and data from the loss of data centers.</li>
<li>If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly available in another zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Virtual Machine Scale Set</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create and manage a group of load-balanced VMs</li>
<li>The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule.</li>
<li>There is no cost for the scale set itself, you only pay for each VM instance that you create.</li>
<li>Virtual machines in a scale set can also be deployed into a single Availability zone, or regionally.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Load Balancer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Combine the Azure Load Balancer with an availability zone or availability set to get the most application resiliency.</li>
<li>Standard tier virtual machines, the Azure Load Balancer is included. </li>
<li>Load balancer helps in increasing availability of website and application</li>
<li>Works at layer 4</li>
<li>It can also be used to balance the load to containers and PaaS applications</li>
<li>Global load balancing with Non-HTTPS as recommended traffic</li>
<li>Supports up to 1000 backend VMs</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2>Azure Firewall</h2>
<h2>Azure Firewall Manager</h2>
<h2>Application Gateway</h2>
<ul>
<li>Works at layer 7</li>
<li>SSL termination</li>
<li>Cookie-based session affinity</li>
<li>Reginal load balancing with HTTPS as recommended traffic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Traffic Manager</h2>
<ul>
<li>Works at layer 7, DNSs load balancer</li>
<li>Load balancer for geographically distributed datacenters</li>
<li>Uses DNS to redirect requests to an appropriate geographical location endpoint</li>
<li>It Does not see the traffic passing between the client and the service. It simply redirects the request based on the most appropriate endpoints</li>
<li>Best suitable for load between two endpoints where your first endpoint is in Azure and the second endpoint placed in an on-premise datacenter</li>
<li>Global LB with Non-HTTPS as recommended traffic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deliver pages and other Web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, from nearest POP.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Azure FrontDoor</h2>
<ul>
<li>Works at layer 7</li>
<li>Offers a single global entry point for customers accessing web apps, APIs, content, and cloud services. </li>
<li>Global load balancing, but it is doing more by enhancing performance</li>
<li>Promptly connect to the nearest Front Door POP</li>
<li>Increase application availability with smart health probes</li>
<li>URL based routing</li>
<li>Cookie-based session affinity</li>
<li>SSL termination</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h2>Azure Bastian</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allows to connect to virtual machine without RDP port open</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>DNS traffic always travel over UDP</li>
<li>When we update DNS servers in Azure Firewall, it will restart the attached virtual machines.</li>
<li>If the virtual machine doesn&#39;t have public IP address we can RDP to VM using the firewall&#39;s public IP.</li>
</ul>
