These patterns promote well-defined relationships between components, facilitate code reuse, and improve overall system flexibility. Here are some of the most prevalent design patterns in web applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model-View-Controller (MVC): This pattern separates the application&#39;s concerns into three distinct layers: the model, the view, and the controller. The model manages the data, the view renders the user interface, and the controller handles user interactions and updates the model accordingly. This separation of concerns promotes loose coupling, making it easier to test, maintain, and extend the application.</li>
<li>Dependency Injection (DI): This pattern provides a mechanism for injecting dependencies into classes without requiring them to explicitly create them. This promotes loose coupling, as classes rely on external components rather than creating them directly, making it easier to test and maintain the code. DI can be implemented through various techniques, such as constructor injection, method injection, and property injection.</li>
<li>Front Controller: This pattern serves as a single entry point for all requests entering the application. It intercepts requests, routes them to the appropriate handlers, and manages the application&#39;s lifecycle. It centralizes request handling, simplifies security management, and reduces the complexity of routing logic.</li>
<li>Singleton: This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists within the application&#39;s lifetime. It is often used for resource-intensive objects, such as database connections or configuration settings, to avoid unnecessary resource duplication and improve performance.</li>
<li>Observer Pattern: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object (the subject) notifies multiple dependent objects (observers) of any changes in its state. It is commonly used for event-driven applications, allowing components to react to changes in other components without direct coupling.</li>
<li>Decorator Pattern: This pattern dynamically attaches additional responsibilities to an object at runtime. It wraps an existing object (the component) and provides additional functionality without altering the original object&#39;s structure. This pattern promotes code reuse and extensibility.</li>
<li>Factory Pattern: This pattern creates objects in a standardized way, often through an interface or factory method. It decouples object creation from the code that uses the objects, promoting flexibility and making it easier to test and maintain the code.</li>
<li>Adapter Pattern: This pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. It acts as an intermediary, allowing incompatible interfaces to communicate and collaborate.</li>
<li>These design patterns provide a foundation for building well-structured, maintainable, and scalable web applications. By applying these patterns effectively, developers can simplify code, enhance flexibility, and improve the overall quality of their web applications.</li>
