<h2>Design Phase</h2>
<h3>Requirement Gathering</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understand User Needs: Gather and analyze user needs, pain points, and expectations to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the application.</li>
<li>Define Use Cases: Create use cases to describe the interactions between users and the system, outlining the steps involved in achieving specific goals.</li>
<li>Establish Requirements Traceability: Implement requirements traceability to link requirements to specific design elements and code components, ensuring that requirements are fully implemented and tested.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Architecture Design</h3>
<ul>
<li>Domain Modeling: Create domain models to represent real-world concepts and their relationships. This helps in understanding the problem domain and designing a well-structured application.</li>
<li>Threat Modeling: Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities early in the design process. This helps in implementing appropriate security measures and mitigating risks.</li>
<li>Define Coding guidelines: Establish coding guidelines to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase. This includes naming conventions, indentation, and code formatting standards.</li>
<li>Define PR review process: Outline a clear and efficient process for code reviews. This ensures that code changes are thoroughly reviewed and approved before merging into the main codebase.</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create User Interface Wireframes: Develop wireframes to represent the layout and functionality of the user interface (UI).</li>
<li>Design User Flows: Create user flows to map out the user&#39;s journey through the application, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.</li>
<li>Define UI Components and Styles: Design UI components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation elements, and establish consistent styling guidelines.</li>
<li>Consider User Accessibility: Ensure the UI design adheres to accessibility guidelines to make the application usable for users with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create Design Documents: Document the design decisions, including architecture diagrams, UI mockups, and detailed descriptions of the application&#39;s components and interactions.</li>
<li>Document Requirements: Document the user requirements, use cases, and functional and non-functional requirements in a clear and organized manner.</li>
<li>Maintain Documentation: Regularly update and maintain documentation to reflect changes in the design and requirements as the project evolves.</li>
</ul>
<p>By thoroughly addressing these activities, the software development design phase sets the stage for a successful software development project, ensuring that the application meets user needs, is well-structured, and can be maintained and evolved effectively over time.</p>
<h2>Execution Phase</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Code &amp; peer Review on Each Check-in: Implement code reviews for every check-in to ensure code quality and adherence to guidelines. This helps in identifying and fixing potential issues early on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Static Code Scanning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan Code with Microsoft Code Analysis: Utilize Microsoft Code Analysis tools to scan code for potential issues, such as performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and code style violations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan Code with InSharp Static Analysis: Employ InSharp static analysis tools to detect potential bugs, code smells, and anti-patterns in the codebase. This helps in improving code quality and maintainability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan Code with SonarQube: Leverage SonarQube to analyze code quality, identify potential issues, and track metrics related to code complexity, duplication, and security.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan Code for performance</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use performance profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize code for better efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan Code for Memory Consumption: Analyze memory usage of the application to identify potential memory leaks and optimize memory management.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimize Images: Optimize images to reduce their file size and improve page loading performance. Use image optimization tools or plugins to automate this process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan code for maintainability</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan Code for Code Complexity: Measure code complexity to identify areas of potential refactoring and improve code maintainability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan code for security</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan Code for Unused Libraries: Identify and remove unused libraries (NuGet packages) to reduce code bloat and potential security vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan Code for Code Vulnerabilities: Utilize tools like Black Duck to scan code for known vulnerabilities and security flaws. This helps in addressing potential security risks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scan Code for Vulnerable Packages: Use tools like dotnet list package --vulnerable or dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive to identify vulnerable packages within the project and its dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run NPM audit to scan JavaScript based applications for vulnerabilities in the installed packages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment Phase</h2>
<h3>Before Production Deployment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Perform a comprehensive code review and testing cycle to ensure the application is ready for production deployment.</li>
<li>Validate the application&#39;s compatibility with the production environment, including operating system, database, and network configurations.</li>
<li>Conduct performance testing to ensure the application can handle expected production workloads.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After Production Deployment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Monitor application performance and resource usage to identify potential issues and optimize performance as needed.</li>
<li>Implement a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment process and quickly roll out fixes and updates.</li>
<li>Continuously scan code for vulnerabilities and address any identified issues promptly.</li>
<li>Gather user feedback and usage data to identify areas for improvement and prioritize future development efforts.</li>
</ul>
