2:T559,<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>No central approval process for adding packages</li>
<li>Anyone can pack anything into a package, give it any name they want (like &quot;Microsoft Prism&quot;, as long as the name is not taken (doesn&#39;t manage trust)</li>
<li>Binaries downloaded from Sourceforge.net, Codeplex.com, etc could feasibly contain malicious code</li>
<li>What if the project is using licensed NuGet. We do not have any mechanism to verify that license terms are followed or not.</li>
<li>There is no check for using an obsolete version of NuGet. Once added never updated</li>
</ol>
<h2>Approach for using packages</h2>
<ol>
<li>Lock in the semantic version number completely. Explicitly specify the major, minor, and patch numbers. Don&#39;t assume that new updates will be safe or that their semantic version will be accurate.</li>
<li>Use only well-known current versions for production.</li>
<li>Experiment with anything in a test environment with limited access e.g. under an account that isn&#39;t a local administrator, no local access to highly privileged credentials, no access rights to privileged resources granted to the test machine&#39;s IP.</li>
<li>Check the vendor/publisher. For example, if the package is released by Microsoft, Amazon and it&#39;s an AWS SDK, then that package is probably safe to use if you trust Amazon.</li>
